  **Part 1**


**supervised learning with R.** 


I will revisit Advertising_online_cytography and create a random forest supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog.

**Unsupervised learning with R**

 **Part 2**

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
I will use k-means and Hierarchical clustering. The main idea of these methods is to put n observations into k groups. The aim is to make each point is closest to their group mean, that is trying to make the sum of square within groups is as small as possible. Use Euclidean distance to calculate the distance into each point. To get the suitable k value, we can use elbow plot, which k is the value making the sum of square within cluster as small as possible. To get optimum number of hierarchies I will plot a dendrogram.
Upon implementation, I will provide comparisons between the two clustering approaches while highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach.
